      "We are going to be doing heavy metal style effects and a bit of growling in the vocals so compression is needed for vocals to sound smooth and i don't want my voice to be very forward i want it to sit right in between the instruments not too forward like last year more so in the middle(sound wise) and also high distortion might lead to some peaks so we need to balance everything the right way",
